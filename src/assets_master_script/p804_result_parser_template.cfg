# "condition_pattern" specifies a regex to extract the condition name from the file name.
# example: Assuming "D501_C03_M2_S02.wav" is a file name,and "03" is the condition name. The pattern will be
# ".*_c(?P<condition_num>\d{1,2})_.*.wav" , you should also use condition_keys
# uncomment both when condition level aggregation is needed
